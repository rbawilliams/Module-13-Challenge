# Alphabet Soup Challenge

![Alt text](Resources/13-challenge-image.png)

## Background
The project is based on an hypothetical venture capital firm. The business team receives numerous funding applications from startups every day and has requested assistance in developing a model that predicts whether applicants will become successful if funded by Alphabet Soup. Using existing knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, the aim is to create a binary classifier model that will predict an applicant's likelihood of success using the data provided in a CSV file containing over 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup.

A CSV file containing more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years is attached to the project. This file contains various types of information about the organisations, including whether they ultimately became successful. With your knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, you decide to use the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become successful.

## Project Overview
To predict an Alphabet Soup funding applicant's success, you will create a binary classification model using a deep neural network. The project comprises three technical deliverables: preprocessing data for a neural network model, using the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model, and optimizing the model.

The project consists of three technical deliverables:

Preprocess data for a neural network model.
Use the model-fit-predict pattern to compile and evaluate a binary classification model.
Optimize the model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is provided by Alphabet Soup and contains information about more than 34,000 organisations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The dataset contains various types of information about the organisations, including whether they ultimately became successful.

## Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

pandas
numpy
sklearn
tensorflow
keras
Usage

## Results
The project will result in a binary classification model that can predict whether an Alphabet Soup funding applicant will become successful. The model will be evaluated on its accuracy and loss metrics.

## Summary and Analysis
The project aims to create a binary classification model that can predict whether an Alphabet Soup funding applicant will become successful. The model will be created using a deep neural network, and will be optimized using various techniques such as adjusting the input data, adding more neurons to a hidden layer, adding more hidden layers, using different activation functions, and increasing or reducing the number of epochs in the training regimen.
